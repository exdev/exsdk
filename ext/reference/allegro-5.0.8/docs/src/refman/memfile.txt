# Memfile interface

The memfile interface allows you to treat a fixed block of contiguous
memory as a file that can be used with Allegro's I/O functions.

These functions are declared in the following header file.
Link with allegro_memfile.

    #include <allegro5/allegro_memfile.h>

## API: al_open_memfile

Returns a file handle to the block of memory. All read and write operations
act upon the memory directly, so it must not be freed while the file remains
open.

The mode can be any combination of "r" (readable) and "w" (writable).
Regardless of the mode, the file always opens at position 0. The file size
is fixed and cannot be expanded. 

It should be closed with [al_fclose]. After the file is closed, you are
responsible for freeing the memory (if needed).

## API: al_get_allegro_memfile_version

Returns the (compiled) version of the addon, in the same format as
[al_get_allegro_version].
