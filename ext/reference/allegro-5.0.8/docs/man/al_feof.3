bool\ al_feof(ALLEGRO_FILE\ *f)
\f[]

.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
Returns true if the end-of-file indicator has been set on the file, i.e.
we have attempted to read \f[I]past\f[] the end of the file.
.PP
This does \f[I]not\f[] return true if we simply are at the end of the
file.
The following code correctly reads two bytes, even when the file
contains exactly two bytes:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
int\ b1\ =\ al_fgetc(f);
int\ b2\ =\ al_fgetc(f);
if\ (al_feof(f))\ {
\ \ \ /*\ At\ least\ one\ byte\ was\ unsuccessfully\ read.\ */
\ \ \ report_error();
}
\f[]
.fi
