.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
Attaches an audio stream to a voice.
The same rules as al_attach_sample_instance_to_voice(3) apply.
This may fail if the driver can\[aq]t create a voice with the buffer
count and buffer size the stream uses.
.PP
An audio stream attached directly to a voice has a number of
limitations.
The audio stream plays immediately and cannot be stopped.
The stream position, speed, gain, panning, cannot be changed.
At this time, we don\[aq]t recommend attaching audio streams directly to
voices.
Use a mixer in between.
.PP
Returns true on success, false on failure.
