\f[C]
#include\ <allegro5/allegro_primitives.h>

.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
Calculates a ribbon given an array of points.
The ribbon will go through all of the passed points.
If \f[C]thickness\ <=\ 0\f[], then \f[C]num_segments\f[] of points are
required in the destination buffer, otherwise twice as many are needed.
The destination and the points buffer should consist of regularly spaced
doublets of floats, corresponding to x and y coordinates of the
vertices.
