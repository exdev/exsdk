#include\ <allegro5/allegro_primitives.h>

void\ al_calculate_arc(float*\ dest,\ int\ stride,\ float\ cx,\ float\ cy,

.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
Calculates an elliptical arc, and sets the vertices in the destination
buffer to the calculated positions.
If \f[C]thickness\ <=\ 0\f[], then \f[C]num_points\f[] of points are
required in the destination, otherwise twice as many are needed.
The destination buffer should consist of regularly spaced (by distance
of \f[C]stride\f[] bytes) doublets of floats, corresponding to x and y
coordinates of the vertices.
