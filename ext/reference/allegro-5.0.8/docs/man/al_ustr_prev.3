.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
Find the byte offset of the previous code point in string, before
\f[C]*pos\f[].
\f[C]*pos\f[] does not have to be at the beginning of a code point.
Returns true on success, then value pointed to by \f[C]pos\f[] will be
updated to the found offset.
Otherwise returns false if \f[C]*pos\f[] was already at the end of the
string, then \f[C]*pos\f[] is unmodified.
.PP
This function just looks for an appropriate byte; it doesn\[aq]t check
if found offset is the beginning of a valid code point.
If you are working with possibly invalid UTF-8 strings then it could
skip over some invalid bytes.
