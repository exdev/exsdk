# Main addon

The `main` addon has no public API, but contains functionality to enable
programs using Allegro to build and run without platform-specific changes.

On platforms that require this functionality (e.g. OSX) this addon contains a
C `main` function that invokes [al_run_main] with the user's own `main`
function, where the user's `main` function has had its name mangled to
something else. The file that defines the user `main` function must include
the header file `allegro5/allegro.h`; that header performs the name mangling
using some macros.

If the user `main` function is defined in C++, then it must have the
following signature for this addon to work:

    int main(int argc, char **argv)

This addon does nothing on platforms that don't require its functionality, but
you should keep it in mind in case you need to port to platforms that do
require it.

Link with allegro_main.
