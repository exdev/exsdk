.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
This function is useful in cases where you don\[aq]t have a main()
function but want to run Allegro (mostly useful in a wrapper library).
Under Windows and Linux this is no problem because you simply can call
al_install_system(3).
But some other system (like OSX) don\[aq]t allow calling
al_install_system(3) in the main thread.
al_run_main will know what to do in that case.
.PP
The passed argc and argv will simply be passed on to user_main and the
return value of user_main will be returned.
