.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
Like free() in the C standard library, but the implementation may be
overridden.
.PP
Additionally, on Windows, a memory block allocated by one DLL must be
freed from the same DLL.
In the few places where an Allegro function returns a pointer that must
be freed, you must use al_free(3) for portability to Windows.
.PP
This is a macro.

al_malloc(3), al_free_with_context(3)
