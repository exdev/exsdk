.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
Defines the generic vertex type, with a 3D position, color and texture
coordinates for a single texture.
Note that at this time, the software driver for this addon cannot render
3D primitives.
If you want a 2D only primitive, set z to 0.
Note that when you must initialize all members of this struct when
you\[aq]re using it.
One exception to this rule are the u and v variables which can be left
uninitialized when you are not using textures.
