.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
An ALLEGRO_EVENT is a union of all builtin event structures, i.e.
it is an object large enough to hold the data of any event type.
All events have the following fields in common:
.TP
.B type (ALLEGRO_EVENT_TYPE)
Indicates the type of event.
.RS
.RE
.TP
.B any.source (ALLEGRO_EVENT_SOURCE *)
The event source which generated the event.
.RS
.RE
.TP
.B any.timestamp (double)
When the event was generated.
.RS
.RE
.PP
By examining the \f[C]type\f[] field you can then access type-specific
fields.
The \f[C]any.source\f[] field tells you which event source generated
that particular event.
The \f[C]any.timestamp\f[] field tells you when the event was generated.
The time is referenced to the same starting point as al_get_time(3).
.PP
Each event is of one of the following types, with the usable fields
given.
.SS ALLEGRO_EVENT_JOYSTICK_AXIS
.PP
A joystick axis value changed.
.TP
.B joystick.id (ALLEGRO_JOYSTICK *)
The joystick which generated the event.
This is not the same as the event source \f[C]joystick.source\f[].
.RS
.RE
.TP
.B joystick.stick (int)
The stick number, counting from zero.
Axes on a joystick are grouped into "sticks".
.RS
.RE
.TP
.B joystick.axis (int)
The axis number on the stick, counting from zero.
.RS
.RE
.TP
.B joystick.pos (float)
The axis position, from -1.0 to +1.0.
.RS
.RE
.SS ALLEGRO_EVENT_JOYSTICK_BUTTON_DOWN
.PP
A joystick button was pressed.
.TP
.B joystick.id (ALLEGRO_JOYSTICK *)
The joystick which generated the event.
.RS
.RE
.TP
.B joystick.button (int)
The button which was pressed, counting from zero.
.RS
.RE
.SS ALLEGRO_EVENT_JOYSTICK_BUTTON_UP
.PP
A joystick button was released.
.TP
.B joystick.id (ALLEGRO_JOYSTICK *)
The joystick which generated the event.
.RS
.RE
.TP
.B joystick.button (int)
The button which was released, counting from zero.
.RS
.RE
.SS ALLEGRO_EVENT_JOYSTICK_CONFIGURATION
.PP
A joystick was plugged in or unplugged.
See al_reconfigure_joysticks(3) for details.
.SS ALLEGRO_EVENT_KEY_DOWN
.PP
A keyboard key was pressed.
.TP
.B keyboard.keycode (int)
The code corresponding to the physical key which was pressed.
See the "Key codes" section for the list of ALLEGRO_KEY_* constants.
.RS
.RE
.TP
.B keyboard.display (ALLEGRO_DISPLAY *)
The display which had keyboard focus when the event occurred.
.RS
.RE
.RS
.PP
\f[I]Note:\f[] this event is about the physical keys being pressed on
the keyboard.
Look for ALLEGRO_EVENT_KEY_CHAR events for character input.
.RE
.SS ALLEGRO_EVENT_KEY_UP
.PP
A keyboard key was released.
.TP
.B keyboard.keycode (int)
The code corresponding to the physical key which was released.
See the "Key codes" section for the list of ALLEGRO_KEY_* constants.
.RS
.RE
.TP
.B keyboard.display (ALLEGRO_DISPLAY *)
The display which had keyboard focus when the event occurred.
.RS
.RE
.SS ALLEGRO_EVENT_KEY_CHAR
.PP
A character was typed on the keyboard, or a character was auto-repeated.
.TP
.B keyboard.keycode (int)
The code corresponding to the physical key which was last pressed.
See the "Key codes" section for the list of ALLEGRO_KEY_* constants.
.RS
.RE
.TP
.B keyboard.unichar (int)
A Unicode code point (character).
This \f[I]may\f[] be zero or negative if the event was generated for a
non-visible "character", such as an arrow or Function key.
In that case you can act upon the \f[C]keycode\f[] field.
.RS
.PP
Some special keys will set the \f[C]unichar\f[] field to their standard
ASCII values: Tab=9, Return=13, Escape=27.
In addition if you press the Control key together with A to Z the
\f[C]unichar\f[] field will have the values 1 to 26.
For example Ctrl-A will set \f[C]unichar\f[] to 1 and Ctrl-H will set it
to 8.
.PP
As of Allegro 5.0.2 there are some inconsistencies in the treatment of
Backspace (8 or 127) and Delete (127 or 0) keys on different platforms.
These can be worked around by checking the \f[C]keycode\f[] field.
.RE
.TP
.B keyboard.modifiers (unsigned)
This is a bitfield of the modifier keys which were pressed when the
event occurred.
See "Keyboard modifier flags" for the constants.
.RS
.RE
.TP
.B keyboard.repeat (bool)
Indicates if this is a repeated character.
.RS
.RE
.TP
.B keyboard.display (ALLEGRO_DISPLAY *)
The display which had keyboard focus when the event occurred.
.RS
.RE
.RS
.PP
\f[I]Note\f[]: in many input methods, characters are \f[I]not\f[]
entered one-for-one with physical key presses.
Multiple key presses can combine to generate a single character, e.g.
apostrophe + e may produce \[aq]Ã©\[aq].
Fewer key presses can also generate more characters, e.g.
macro sequences expanding to common phrases.

.SS ALLEGRO_EVENT_DISPLAY_LOST
.PP
When using Direct3D, displays can enter a "lost" state.
In that state, drawing calls are ignored, and upon entering the state,
bitmap\[aq]s pixel data can become undefined.
Allegro does its best to preserve the correct contents of bitmaps (see
ALLEGRO_NO_PRESERVE_TEXTURE) and restore them when the device is "found"
(see ALLEGRO_EVENT_DISPLAY_FOUND).
However, this is not 100% fool proof.
.PP
To ensure that all bitmap contents are restored accurately, one must
take additional steps.
The best procedure to follow if bitmap constancy is important to you is
as follows: first, always have the ALLEGRO_NO_PRESERVE_TEXTURE flag set
to true when creating bitmaps, as it incurs pointless overhead when
using this method.
Second, create a mechanism in your game for easily reloading all of your
bitmaps -- for example, wrap them in a class or data structure and have
a "bitmap manager" that can reload them back to the desired state.
Then, when you receive an ALLEGRO_EVENT_DISPLAY_FOUND event, tell the
bitmap manager (or whatever your mechanism is) to restore your bitmaps.
