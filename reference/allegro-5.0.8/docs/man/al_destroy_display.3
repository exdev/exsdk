.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
Destroy a display.
.PP
If the target bitmap of the calling thread is tied to the display, then
it implies a call to "al_set_target_bitmap(NULL);" before the display is
destroyed.
.PP
That special case notwithstanding, you should make sure no threads are
currently targeting a bitmap which is tied to the display before you
destroy it.
