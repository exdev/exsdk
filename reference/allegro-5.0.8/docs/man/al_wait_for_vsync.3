.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
Wait for the beginning of a vertical retrace.
Some driver/card/monitor combinations may not be capable of this.
.PP
Note how al_flip_display(3) usually already waits for the vertical
retrace, so unless you are doing something special, there is no reason
to call this function.
.PP
Returns false if not possible, true if successful.
