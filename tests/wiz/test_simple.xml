                I am a newcomer to the world of WebKit. Before starting here at Adobe 
                I had never even looked at the source code, so I had quite a bit of learning 
                to do once I started. I’ve done a few things in WebKit since then, 
                but I’m definitely still in the early stages – it is a large, complex project! 
                WebKit has a lot of documentation, but due to the rapid pace of change 
                in the code base, much of it is very high level or outdated. As a beginner, 
                I found this to be rather challenging when trying to learn the ins and 
                outs of the layout system.

                Out of this challenge grew the desire to do make it less challenging for others, 
                and help my learning process at the same time. I’ve found that the best way to 
                learn something is to explain it to someone else, so I am beginning a series 
                of posts about learning WebKit and WebKit layout. This first post will focus 
                on the basics and pointers to documentation that has helped me along the way. 
                Note that I assume that you have a working knowledge of HTML, CSS, and 
                JavaScript. I also assume that you have a knowledge of C languages, as WebKit 
                itself is written in C++. You shouldn’t need any great knowledge of C++ to 
                follow along, but you will definitely need to learn C++ if you want to contribute 
                to the code.
